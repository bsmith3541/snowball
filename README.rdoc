What up homies?

Snowball is a web crawler that scans the user's Tumblr profile to verify the Tumblr "inner circle" once and for all. Uncovering the inner circle is the main motivation for this application; should the theory prove wrong, this crawler will at least tell you which blogs have the most influence on you by visualizing where most of your personalized content comes from.
